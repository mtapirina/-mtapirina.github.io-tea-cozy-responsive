Making a Website Responsive _ Codecademy

Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design 
spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. 
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. 
This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.
